![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning–based text classification system to detect spam and non-spam (ham) messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Spam messages pose security risks and reduce user trust. This project demonstrates how NLP techniques can automatically classify messages as spam or legitimate.

## 📊 Dataset
- SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI Repository)
- Labels: spam, ham

## 🧠 Approach
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Train-test split with stratification
- Model training and comparison

## ⚙️ Models Used
- Multinomial Naive Bayes (Primary)
- Logistic Regression (Comparison)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLP (TF-IDF)
- Joblib

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python spam_mail_detector.py
<!-- Project finalized and ready for portfolio showcase -->
